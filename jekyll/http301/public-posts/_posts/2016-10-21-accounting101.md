## Financial Statement

### Balance Sheet
- Financial position (i.e., listing of resources and obligations) on a specific date
- `Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders'Equity`
- This equation must always balance!

#### Definition of Assets, Liabilities, Stockholders'Equity

**Assets**
- Resources owned by a business that are expected to provide future economic benefits (either provide cash coming in or save the company from having to spend cash in the future)

**Liabilities**
- Claims on assets by "creditors" (non-owners) that represent an obligation to make future payment of cash, goods, or services

**Stockholders'Equity**
- Claims on assets by owners of business
- Contributed Capital (arises from sale of shares)
- Retained Earnings (arises from operations)
 - Increased by Revenues
 - Decreased by Expenses and Dividends

### Income Statement

- Results of operations over a period of time using **accrual account** (i.e., recognition tied to business activities, not to cash flows)
- `Net income = Revenues - Expenses`

#### Revenue vs Income vs Profit vs Earning

**Revenue**: Revenue is simply the total amount of **cash generated by the sale** of products or services associated with the company's primary operations, **less any returns or discounts**. It can also be thought of as [net sales](http://www.investopedia.com/video/play/net-sales/).

> E.g.For a grocery store, this includes the sale of anything found in the store, from vegetables to floral arrangements

**Income**: In a financial context, the term income almost always refers the *net income*, is a concrete concept. Also referred to as **net profit**.

Net income accounts for **every dime that flows in and out of a company**. It includes expenses for product manufacturing, operations, debt payments and other obligations, as well as additional income streams from subsidiary holdings, asset sales, and other considerations.

**Income =(often refer to)=> Net Income <==> Net Profit**

**Profit**: Profit is the revenue that remains after expenses are paid, and **it can refer to a number of figures at a number of levels**.

> For example, gross profit is revenue less the cost of goods sold. Operating profit is revenue minus the cost of goods sold and operating expenses.

**Earning**: A company's earnings are equal to **revenue** less **costs of production** over a given period of time. Earnings typically refer to after-tax net income.

A company's earnings are equal to revenue less costs of production over a given period of time. Profit is equal to total revenue less all expenses.
In the right context, these could be equal to each other, although that is **rare**.
**Big gaps between earnings and profits might be a sign the company spends too much time and money on unproductive activity.**

### Statement of Cash flows

- Sources and uses of cash over a period of time
- Operating activities
 - The provision of goods or services and other normal business activities
- Investing activities
 - The acquisition or disposal of long-lived productive assets
- Financing activities
 - Transactions related to owners or creditors

---

## Sources of Financial Statement

- Company's website
 - I.e. bottom page -> Investor Relations -> Financial -> annual report
- SEC Edgar website
- Internet finance site
 - Morningstar
 - Google finance
 - Yahoo finance
 - Reuters
- Wharton Research Data Science
 - Very expensive

## Ratio Analysis

### Dupont Analysis

![DuPont Analysis Framework](../assets/DuPontAnalysis-Framework.jpg)

~~~
ROE = ROA * Leverage
ROA = Net Income / Avg. Total Assets

ROE = (ROS * Asset Turnover) * Leverage
ROE = (Profitability * Efficiency) * Leverage

ROE = (Net Income / Sales) * (Sales / Assets) * (Assets / Equity)
~~~

#### De-levered Net Income

ROA would measure operating performance **independent of the company’s financing decisions**
- But, the numerator of ROA, Net Income, includes: *Interest Expense*
 - `More leverage => higher Interest Expense => lower Net Income`
- To truly **remove all financing effects from ROA**, we must **de-lever** *Net Income*
- `ROA = De-Levered Net Income / Avg. Assets`
- `De-levered Net Income = Net Income + (1 - tax rate) x Interest Expense`

##### An example of De-levered Net Income

|                             | Company A (No debt) | Company B (Some debt)         |
|-----------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| Pretax, pre-interest income | 300                 | 300                           |
| Interest expense            | 0                   | 50                            |
| Pretax income               | 300                 | 250                           |
| Taxes (35%)                 | 105                 | 87.5                          |
| Net Income                  | 195                 | 162.5                         |
| De-levered Net Income       | 195                 | 195 (162.5 + 50 * (1 - 0.35)) |


#### An example of competitor comparison

![RatioAnalysis-competitor-comparison](../assets/RatioAnalysis-competitor-comparison.png)

##### A couple things to look at for beginners

- How does the industry perform?
- What's the trend of ROE for each company?
- Who drives ROE in each company? (Who caused the increase/decrease of ROE)
- Does the company perform good/so so/bad?

#### Quick note on finding comparison firms

One approach is to look at standard classification schemes for industries
- [SICCodes](https://www.osha.gov/pls/imis/sic_manual.html)
- [NAICSCodes](http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/sssd/naics/naicsrch?chart=2012)

Another approach is to look at who analysts and data services use as comparisons for the company
- Analyst reports will often mention competitors
- Google Finance give a list of “RelatedCompanies”
- Reuters gives Industry and Sector comparisons

### Profitability and Turnover Ratios

#### Profitability

What are the drivers of profitability?
Decompose Return on Sales by income statement line item

- `Gross Margin = (Sales - Cost of Goods Sold) / Sales`
 - Sales <=> [Operating Revenue](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operating-revenue.asp)
 - *Cost of goods sold (COGS)* are the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold by a company.
 - [Read more: Cost Of Goods Sold - COGS Definition - Investopedia](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cogs.asp#ixzz4Nwub5nL2 )
- `SG&A-to-Sales = SG&A Expense / Sales`
 - SG&A: Selling, General and Administrative Expenses, which is a major non-production cost presented in an income statement
- `Operating Margin = Operating Income / Sales`
 - A measurement of what proportion of a company's revenue is left over after paying for variable costs of production such as wages, raw materials, etc.
 - An indicator of a company's pricing strategy and operating efficiency.
 - [Read more: Operating Margin Definition - Investopedia](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operatingmargin.asp#ixzz4Nx2BNy6H)
 - `Operating Income = Gross Income - Operating Expenses - Depreciation - Amortization`
 - [Read more: Operating Income Definition - Investopedia](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operatingincome.asp#ixzz4NxMBq46V)
- `Interest Expense-to-Sales = Interest Expense / Sales`
- `Effective Tax Rate = Income Taxes / Pre-tax Income`
 - Pre-tax income = the firm's earnings before taxes
 - The tax is calculated by different tax brackets
 - [Read more: Effective Tax Rate Definition - Investopedia](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/effectivetaxrate.asp)

##### Gross Margin vs Operating Margin

- `Gross margin (profit) = (revenue - cost of goods) / revenue`
 - Revenue <=> Operating Revenue <=> Sales
- `Operating margin (net profit) = (revenue - cost of goods - operating expenses - other expenses - interest - taxes) / revenue`
 - A more accurate measure of a company's profitability
 - Examining its net profit margin can help a company gain a much clearer picture of its overall expenses compared to revenue

[Read more: What is the difference between gross profit margin and net profit margin? - Investopedia](http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/021215/what-difference-between-gross-profit-margin-and-net-profit-margin.asp#ixzz4NwkcjZs7)

![Profitability-Example](../assets/Profitability-Example.png)

#### Asset Turnover (Efficiency) Ratios

*Turnover Ratio* in general tells us: How many times per year do we cycle through accounts?
Example: Inventory Turnover of 8 means that we build and sell Inventory 8 times per year, on average.

- `Inventory Turnover = Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) / Average Inventory`
- `Accounts Receivable Turnover = Sales / Average Accounts Receivable`
- `Accounts Payable Turnover = Purchases / Average Accounts Payable`
 - (`Purchases = Ending Inventory + COGS – Beginning Inventory`)
- `Fixed Asset Turnover = Sales / Avg. Net PP&E`
 - PP&E: Property, plant and equipment

> These turnover ratios are hard to interpret

![TurnoverRatios](../assets/TurnoverRatios.png)

> *Days Outstanding Ratios* are **transformable** to *turnover ratios* and more **intuitive** than *turnover ratios*.

#### Days Outstanding Ratios

How many days, on average, are accounts outstanding?
Example: Days Inventory of 45 means that it takes 45 days,on average, from the time we start building Inventory until we sell it

- `Days Inventory = 365 * (Average Inventory / Cost of Goods Sold)`
- `Days Receivable (Sales) Outstanding = 365 * (Average Accounts Receivable / Sales)`
- `Days Payable = 365 * (Average Accounts Payable / Purchases)`
- `Net Trade Cycle = Days Receivable + Days Inventory - Days Payable`
 - Net Trade Cycle represents the gap between cash outflows and cash inflows that we have to bridge with short-term borrowing

![NetTradeCycle](../assets/NetTradeCycle.png)

### Liquidity Ratios

It tells a company's cash position: e.g., have cash to pay out in short-term, borrowing capacity.

![CommonLiquidityRatios](../assets/CommonLiquidityRatios.png)

#### Short-Term Liquidity Ratios

Does the company have enough cash coming in to cover obligations to pay out cash?
Ideally,ratios would be over 1.

- `Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities`
 - Keep in mind some current assets are non-cash pre-paids
 - Keep in mind some liabilities are non-cash unearned revenue
 - *Current Ratio* is just an approximation, because of it, we have the *Quick Ratio*
- `Quick Ratio = (Cash + Receivables) / Current Liabilities`
- `Cash from Operations(CFO) to Current Liabilities = CFO / Avg. Current Liabilities`
 - It tells us did the business generate enough cash during the period to cover its avg. level of current liabilities

#### Interest Coverage Ratios

Does the company have enough cash coming in from operations to cover interest obligations?
Ideally,ratios would be over 1.

- `Interest Coverage = (Operating Income before Depreciation) / Interest Expense`
- `Cash Interest Coverage = (Cash from Operations + Cash Interest Paid + Cash Taxes) / Cash Interest Paid`
 - more direct measure than *Interest Coverage*

#### Long Term Debt Ratios

How does the company finance its growth?
Also provide measure of bankruptcy risk and borrowing capacity

- `Debt to Equity = Total Liabilities / Total Stockholders’ Equity`
 - *Total Assets* is sometimes used in the denominator
- `Long-Term-Debt to Equity = Total Long-Term Debt / Total Stockholders’ Equity`
- `Long-Term Debt to Tangible Assets = Total Long-Term Debt / (Total Assets - Intangible Assets)`

### Forecasting

#### Common Size Financial Statements

Derived from historical financial statements to help forecasting the trends

- Common Size Balance Sheet
 - Express all numbers as a percent of Total Assets
- Common Size Income Statement
 - Express all numbers as a percent of Sales
- Cash Flow Statement
 - Typically not common sized

##### Benefits

- Remove effects of growth to help spot trends in the financial statements
 - Growth in Assets and Sales drive trends in all of the line items
 - Are certain line items growing more or less than would be expected given the growth in assets or sales?
- Facilitate preparation of forecasted future financial statements
 - Combine historical common size statements with growth forecasts to get future statements
