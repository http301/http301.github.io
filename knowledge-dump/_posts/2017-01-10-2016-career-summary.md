Part of the performance review

Talk about accomplishments, challenges, and opportunities.

## Two main accomplishments of 2016

1. Connectifier provisioning system design and implementation after acquisition
2. Help Connectifier DMZ migration

---

## Breakdown of quarterly objectives and actions toward finishing these goals

### 2nd Quarter: NPI sign-off and miscellaneous tasks
* Write a prototype of CssSelectorGenerator that tries to detect broken parsers periodically and auto-fix them
* Fix bugs
* Start Connectifier NPI testing and sign-off, add needed enums and coordinate with four teams and drive it moving forward

### 3rd Quarter: Provisioning
* Understand how LinkedIn manual/auto provisioning system works by reading code, docs and asking people.
* Design and write code on both Connectifier and LinkedIn side to implement Connectifier manual and auto provisioning system.
* Finish Connectifier NPI sign-off

### 4th Quarter: Provisioning + DMZ migration
* Provisioning: integration tested locally, then stuck on end to end test
* DMZ migration: fix and replace some broken code components and unit tests

---

## Goals in 2017:

### 1.Better time estimate and project driving,Â 

* breaking down tasks more appropriate, make sure every task can be coded up in a day, schedule four tasks a week, leave one day as a buffer. (# of failures of breaking down a task, to be quantified)
* estimate time cost more accurate, identify difficulties earlier; break down big project earlier, go through each task in depth before implementation (# of OKR delays that is caused by myself, to be quantified)
* avoid unexpected big obstacles happen like DMZ migration (should not happen again)

### 2.Better code quality & performance

* fewer bugs (to be quantified), less deployment failure (maximum one deployment failure ever two-quarters)
* no performance issue that causes performance concern, feature broken or site down (one at most)
* fewer review comments (only important comments, to be quantified)

### 3.More efficient independent problem solving

* any knowledge spent more than **30 minutes** should be written down and summarized. a good time to Summarize it is a Friday afternoon
* any insight on bugs or debugging tricks ....
* leave a big chunk of time every week for summarizing things
* learn more tools & frameworks: *play framework*, *sbt* **in depth**
* Apprentice system design interview
