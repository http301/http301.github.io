# AMD 2017 Q1 earning summary

* TOC
{:toc}

## Positive analysis

AMD satisfied analyst expectations for earnings:

 * 18% growth in revenue, revenue of $984.4 million.
 * quarterly losses just one third ($0.04 per share) of what the company lost one year ago ($0.12 per share)

### Wells Fargo - price target to $13 to $15 per share.

### Other - $17 a share

AMD's Ryzen line of desktop CPUs is gaining traction in the market


## Negative analysis

### Goldman Sachs - price target to $10.60 per share.

* **Operating costs** are rising
* **free cash flow** has already turned negative at AMD:
	* ran negative to the tune of $322 million in cash burnt during the quarter

According to AMD:

> Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $943 million at the end of the quarter, down $321 million from the end of the prior quarter primarily due to the timing of sales and cash collections, debt interest payments, and increased inventory.

### Citigroup - price target at just $4 a share

* AMD cuts its **gross margin** guidance by 60 basis points, which implies that added revenue may not add much to AMD's profit.
* AMD's **inventory** and valuation are at the all-time highs despite the company losing money

### Other

* Any market share AMD is gaining from Intel will quickly be lost again to Intel when it cuts prices on its chips to win back customers from AMD.
* And with AMD warning that its gross margin is already starting to ebb, AMD may not be able to survive a price war against Intel.
