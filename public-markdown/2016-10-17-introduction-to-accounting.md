The general accounting equation is as follows:
Assets=Equity+Liabilities
A=E+L

The extended accounting equation is as follows:
Assets+Expenses=Equity/Capital+Liabilities+Income
A+Ex=E+L+I.

This can also be rewritten in the equivalent form:
Assets=Liabilities+Equity/Capital+(Income-Expenses)
A=L+E+(I-Ex)

| Account type   | Debit | Credit |
|----------------|-------|--------|
| Asset          | +     | -      |
| Expense        | +     | -      |
| Liability      | -     | +      |
| Income/Revenue | -     | +      |
| Equity/Capital | -     | +      |
